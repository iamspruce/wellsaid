# Specific to your project's caches
# Hugging Face models cache (typically outside project, but good to include if you ever set HF_HOME within project)
# On your local machine, the actual cache is usually in ~/.cache/huggingface/
# If you ever mount a volume to /cache directly inside your project, you'd ignore that.
# For typical usage, it's outside the repo.

# LanguageTool download cache
# If you explicitly set LANGUAGE_TOOL_DOWNLOAD_DIR to be inside your project,
# e.g., to something like ./languagetool_cache, then you would uncomment/add that:
# languagetool_cache/
# On your local machine, this is often in ~/.cache/languagetool/ or ~/.languagetool.org/

# If you specifically download models/data files INTO your project folder
# (e.g., for SpaCy models if not in standard spaCy data dir)
# spacy_models/

# Log files created by your application
*.log
